Oroborus Readme
===============

Oroborus is a small yet fully featured GNOME compliant window manager for the
X Window System. It is distributed under the GPL (see LICENSE for more details).

The code is sort of based on AEWM by Decklin Foster in that I studied that code
to find out how a window manager works. It has since evolved into something
quite beautiful.

The I18N internationalisation code was taken from the TWM I18N patch from the
I18N documentation available at www.debian.org.

The main aim of Oroborus is to be small and light with very few fancy features,
so there are no docks, no taskbars, no root menus and no icons. These can be
added quite easily by either using Oroborus with GNOME or using some other
applications that provide the required functionality.

Have fun!
