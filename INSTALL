Installation
============

Type the following:

	./configure
	make
	make install

The default install locations are /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share.

If you want to change the install location, use configure's --prefix option
e.g. ./configure --prefix=/usr will install into /usr/bin and /usr/share.

If you want to enable debugging output use the --enable-debug option.
