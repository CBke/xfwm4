Description: window manager of the XFce project
 This package contains xfwm4 which is scheduled to be the window manager
 of the Xfce project, version 4. Therefore, it is designed to run with
 the Xfce panel. Of course, you can run xfwm4 also with any other WM or
 even without one.
 .
 Install xfwm4 if you want a small, resource saving window manager which
 complies to the standards defined at http://www.freedesktop.org/. But
 be warned: If you install and run xfwm4 standalone, you won't be able to 
 do anything since it doesn't have a menu. Thus, we recommend to install
 xfce4 additionally.
